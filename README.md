I used this project to send me a notification email once a spot opened up in a class. 
This is set up to work for any Rice course, but you could modify the code slightly to work for any university that has similar public course profile pages.
For Rice students, this will only work for non-waitlist courses (or once the waitlist expires). If there is a waitlist, it will send false positives since 
a spot may open, but only students on the waitlist can add it. If you are on a waitlist, the system already notifies you when a spot opens, so this would
be useless anyway.

This project got me into EEPS 103 as a sophomore. For reference, this class had 18 spots and 27 seniors, 11 juniors, and 6 sophomore requesting it, so I had
a 0% chance of getting it outright. Hope it can help anyone reading this!
